</a></div>
<h2>WINDSOR CASTLE.</h2>
<h3>GEORGE THE FOURTH&rsquo;S GATEWAY, FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE
QUADRANGLE.</h3>
<p>We wish the reader to consider this Engraving as the first of a
Series of Illustrations of Windsor Castle, in which it will be our
aim to show how far the renovations lately completed or now in
progress are likely to improve the olden splendour of this
stupendous pile. This, we are persuaded, would be matter of
interest at any time, but will be especially so during the coming
summer and autumn, when, it is reasonable enough to expect that
Windsor will double its number of curious visiters. During the late
King&rsquo;s reign, the Castle more resembled one wide, vast
solitude than the abode of a numerous court. An occasional banquet
enlivened its halls, though it only rendered more painful the
solitariness by which it was succeeded. Affliction too broke in
upon the life of the Royal tenant, and stripped regal state of all
its mimic joys, till pain and long protracted suffering welcomed
the happy sleep of death. An occupant of <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span>
different tastes and habits has succeeded; domestic enjoyment has
once more become the characteristic of the British court, and the
Sovereign has cherished the affections of his people by admitting
them to the enjoyment of certain privileges, which, though
unimportant in themselves, have a grateful effect in identifying
interests and considerations which were commonly considered as very
remote. The terrace and slopes of the Castle have been thrown open
to the public, the park grounds are no longer kept clear of
visiters, and access to the Castle itself may be much more freely
enjoyed than during the late reign. The King and the Queen may be
seen daily in the real luxury of conjugal and domestic comfort.
Plainness of purpose, and affectionate amiability of manners, have
done much towards their popularity; and the love of a good and wise
people cannot be better secured than by such fostering
consideration from their rulers; nay, its paternal influence is but
part and parcel of the grand scheme of civilization and
society.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the details of the Print, we may observe that in
our eleventh volume we gave three engravings illustrative of the
Castle improvements; one of which represented the gateway named
after the late Sovereign, and seen from the Long <em>Walk</em>. The
present Engraving is the other side of the gateway, as seen from
the interior of the square or quadrangle. This new gate was
externally completed in 1826. The natural application of the fine
avenue, called the Long Walk, was thus realized. The gateway
consists of two towers the York and Lancaster. The foundations and
walls of the York Tower were part of the old building&mdash;the
Lancaster is entirely new. These towers which have machiolated
battlements, are about 100 feet high; the gateway between them is
24 feet high. In our former Engraving, the gateway was in the
distance, but the present being a near view, shows the solidity,
largeness of proportions, and the boldness of the building, to
greater advantage. The appearance of the whole is extremely
beautiful, although its newness and cleanness remind us of Mr.
Bowles&rsquo;s eccentric observation, that &ldquo;it looks as if it
was washed every morning with <em>soap and water</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here it may be as well to state that Windsor Castle is divided
into the upper and lower wards. The lower contains the
ecclesiastical portions of the edifice, including St.
George&rsquo;s Chapel. The upper ward is formed by the celebrated
Round Tower on the west; the state apartments, including St.
George&rsquo;s Hall, on the north; and a range of domestic
apartments on the east and south, which communicate with the state
apartments. The whole building is thus a hollow square, of which
the three outer sides on the north, east, and south, are surrounded
with a magnificent terrace. The Inner Court, or Quadrangle, is a
connected building of three sides, the fourth being formed by the
Round Tower, or Keep.</p>
<p>The improvements of the interior of the Quadrangle having been
already detailed by us,<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> we pass on
to observe, that the low French windows of St. George&rsquo;s Hall,
which faces the side in our Engraving, have been replaced by long
pointed arch windows, of elegant proportions. Nothing can exceed
the splendour of the look-out from these windows through the arched
entrance to the &ldquo;lengthened vista,&rdquo; or Long Walk, as
shown in the Engraving. The interior of the Hall is nearly
completed; &ldquo;the length, 200 feet, is too great for the
width;&rdquo;<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
"#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> the carved ceiling, and the arms of
the Knights of the Garter, from the first institution of the order,
are exquisitely emblazoned on shields or escutcheons. Beautifully
as they are executed, we scarcely like their whole effect, which is
undoubtedly marred by the proportions of the hall itself. Perhaps
they are too near a blaze of chivalric splendour for these days of
cold calculation. The ball-room, adjoining in St. George&rsquo;s
Hall, is nearly completed. The decorations are gold and white, in
the florid style of the time of Louis the Fourteenth, superb and
showy; four pieces of tapestry are let into the walls, which,
observes the <em>Athen&aelig;um</em>, really look like some of
Rubens&rsquo;s stupendous works now in the Grosvenor collection. We
have not seen these apartments since last summer, when the
decorations were in a forward state. We were surprised at the
coarseness of the gilding, when examined closely; we saw, too, that
where one of the entrances to the Ball-room had been heightened,
the original, door had been <em>pieced</em>, which was a work of
economy we did not look for in the repairs of a palace.</p>
<p>It is gratifying to learn that the erection of a colossal statue
of George III. on Snow Hill, in the Long Walk, is in progress. This
is a testimony of the filial affection of the late King, and should
not be overlooked in his character.</p>

<h3>STERNE&rsquo;S ELIZA.</h3>
<h4>(<em>To the Editor.</em>)</h4>
<p>Though a perusal of your pages evidently shows that you wish
more for original communications than to copy from any one, yet the
extreme beauty of the following article (which I exactly copy as it
appeared translated in the <em>European Magazine</em> for March,
1784) makes one hope to see it revived or preserved in the
<em>Mirror</em>.</p>
<p>A CONSTANT READER.</p>
<h4>&ldquo;<em>For the European Magazine.</em></h4>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. DRAPER, the lady who has been so celebrated as the
correspondent of Mr. STERNE, under the name of ELIZA, will
naturally attract the notice of the Public. That she was deserving
of the encomiums bestowed upon her by that <em>admirable
writer</em> will appear from the following eulogium, written by the
excellent Abbe RAYNAL, which I transmit to you for publication in
your next Magazine.&mdash;I am yours, &amp;c. A.T.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Territory of <em>Anjengo</em>,<a id="footnotetag3" name=
"footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> thou art
nothing; but thou hast given birth to Eliza. A day will come, when
these staples of commerce, founded by the Europeans on the coasts
of Asia, will exist no more. Before a few centuries are elapsed,
the grass will cover them, or the Indians, <em>avenged</em>, will
have built upon their ruins. But if my works be destined to have
any duration, the name of Anjengo will not be obliterated from the
memory of man. Those who shall read my works, or those whom the
winds shall drive towards these shores, will say&mdash;There it is
that Eliza Draper was born; and if there be a Briton among them, he
will immediately add, with the spirit of conscious pride&mdash;And
there it was that she was born of English parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be permitted to indulge my grief, and to give a
free course to my tears! Eliza was my friend. Reader,
whosoe&rsquo;er thou art, forgive me this involuntary
motion;&mdash;let my mind dwell upon Eliza. If I have sometimes
moved thee to compassionate the calamities of the human race, let
me now prevail upon thee to commiserate my own misfortune. I was
thy friend without knowing thee; be for a moment mine. Thy gentle
pity shall be my reward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eliza ended her days in the land of her forefathers, at
the age of three-and-thirty. A celestial soul was separated from a
heavenly body. Ye who visit the spot on which her sacred ashes
rest, write upon the marble that covers them: In such a year, in
such a month, on such a day, at such an hour, God withdrew his
spirit, and Eliza died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou, <em>original writer</em>, her admirer and her
friend, it was Eliza who inspired <em>thy works</em>, and dictated
to thee the most affecting pages of them. <em>Fortunate Sterne,
thou art no more</em>, and I am left behind. I wept <em>over thee
with Eliza</em>; thou wouldst weep over her with me: and had it
been the will of Heaven, that you had both survived me, your tears
would have fallen together upon my grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men were used to say, that no woman had so many
graces as Eliza: the women said so too. They all praised her
candour; they all extolled her sensibility; they were all ambitious
of the honour of her acquaintance. The stings of envy were never
pointed against unconscious merit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anjengo, it is to the influence of thy happy climate that
she certainly was indebted for that almost incompatible harmony of
voluptuousness and decency which diffused itself over all her
person, and accompanied all her motions. A statuary who would have
wished to represent Voluptuousness, would have taken her for his
model; and she would equally have served for him who might have had
a figure of Modesty to display. Even <em>the gloomy and clouded sky
of England</em> had not been able to obscure the brightness of that
a&euml;rial kind of soul, unknown in our climates. In every thing
that Eliza did, an irresistible charm was diffused around her.
Desire, but of <em>a timid and bashful cast</em>, followed her
steps in silence. Any man of courteousness alone must have loved
her, but would not have <em>dared</em> to own his passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I search for Eliza every where; I discover, I discern,
some of her features, some of her charms, scattered among those
women whose figure is most interesting. But what is become of her
who united them all? Nature, who hast exhausted thy gifts to form
an Eliza, didst thou create her only for one moment? Didst thou
make her to be admired for one instant, and to be for ever
regretted?</p>
<p>&ldquo;All who have seen Eliza regret her. As for myself, my
tears will never cease to flow for her all the time I have to live.
But is this sufficient! Those who have known <em>her tenderness for
me</em>, the confidence she had bestowed upon me, will they not say
to me&mdash;She is no more, and yet thou livest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eliza intended to quit her country, her relations, her friends,
to take up her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name=
"page276"></a>[pg 276]</span> residence along <em>with me</em>, and
spend her days in the midst of mine. What happiness had I not
promised to myself? What joy did I not expect, from seeing her
sought after by men of genius, and beloved by women of the nicest
taste? I said to myself, Eliza is young, and thou art near thy
latter end. It is she <em>who will close thine eyes</em>. Vain
hope! Fatal reverse of all human probabilities! My old age has been
prolonged beyond the days of her youth. <em>There is now no person
in the world existing for me. Fate has condemned me to live, and
die alone.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Eliza&rsquo;s mind was cultivated, but the effects of
this art were never perceived. It had done nothing more than
embellish nature; it served in her, only to make the charm more
lasting. Every instant increased the delight she inspired; every
instant rendered her more interesting. Such is the impression she
had left in India; such is the impression she made in Europe.
Eliza, then, <em>was very beautiful</em>? No, she was simply
beautiful; but there was no beauty she did not eclipse, because she
was the only one that was like herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eliza has written; and the men of her nation, whose works
have been the most abounding in elegance and taste, would not have
disavowed the small number of pages she has left behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw Eliza, I experienced a sensation unknown to
me. It was too warm to be no more than friendship; it was too pure
to be love. Had it been a passion, Eliza would have pitied me; she
would have endeavoured to bring me back to my reason, and I should
have completely lost it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eliza used frequently to say, that she had a greater
esteem for me than any one else. At present I may believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her last moments Eliza&rsquo;s thoughts were fixed
upon her friend; and I cannot write a line without having before me
the monument she has left me. Oh! that she could also have endowed
my pen with her graces and her virtue!&mdash;Methinks, at least, I
hear her say&mdash;&lsquo;That stern muse that looks at you, is
History, whose awful duty it is to determine the opinion of
posterity. That fickle deity that hovers o&rsquo;er the globe, is
Fame, who condescended to entertain us a moment about you; she
brought me thy works, and paved the way for our connection by
esteem. Behold that phoenix immortal amidst the flames: it is the
symbol of Genius, which never dies. Let these emblems perpetually
incite thee to shew thyself the defender of <em>humanity</em>, of
<em>truth</em>, and of <em>liberty</em>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eliza, from the highest Heaven, thy first, and last
country, receive my oath: &ldquo;<em>I swear not to write one line
in which thy friend may not be recognised</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF THE WORD BRITANNIA.</h2>
<h3>(<em>To the Editor.</em>)</h3>
<p>I discovered the following curious information in a Classical
Dictionary appended to a very old Latin Thesaurus, written by
Cooper, Bishop of Norwich, in the early part of the reign of
Elizabeth; which, as its authenticity may be relied on, affords an
easy solution to a difficulty that has puzzled many. I speak of the
origin of the name <em>Britannia</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 30 yeres sence, it hapned in Wilshire, at Juy
Church, aboute two myles from Sarisbury, as men digged to make a
foundation, they founde an holow stone couered with another stone,
wherin they founde a booke, hauevinge in it little above xx leaves
(as they saide) of very thicke vellume, wherin was some things
written. But when it was shewed to priests and chanons, whiche were
there, they could not reade it. Wherfore after they had tossed it
from one to another (by the meanes wherof it was torne) they did
neglecte and caste it aside. Long after a peece therof happened to
come to my handes: whiche notwithstandynge it was all to rente
defaced, I shewed to Maister Richard Pace, than chiefe secretary to
the kynges moste royal majestie, wherof he exceedingly rejoysed.
But because it was partely rente, partely defaced and blourred with
meate (or weate) whiche had fallen on it, he could not finde any
one sentence perfect. Notwithstandynge after longe beholdynge, he
shewed me, it seemed that the said booke conteined some auncient
monument of this yle, and that he perceived this woorde
<em>Prytania</em>, to be put for <em>Brytannia</em>. But at that
tyme he sayde no more to me. Afterwarde, I gevyng much study and
diligence to the readynge of hystories, consyderynge wherof this
woorde <em>Britannia</em> first came, fyndynge that all the yles in
this parte in the occean, were called <em>Brittani&aelig;</em>,
after conjecture of Albion, remebringe (remembering) the sayde
wrytynge, and by chaunce fyndyng in Suidas, that <em>Prytania</em>
in Greeke, with a circumflexed aspiratio (aspiration,) doeth
signifie metalles, fayres and markettes, also revenues belongyng to
the commune treasure: I then conceyved this opinion, that the
Greekes flourishynge in wisdome, prowesse, and experience, of
saylynge, beynge entred into the occean sea, founde in the yles
greate plenty of tyn, leade, yron, brasse, and in divers places
golde and sylver in great quantitie, they called all those yles
(isles) by this generall name Prytania, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have, with few exceptions, preserved the spelling.</p>

<h2>POLAND.</h2>
<h3>(<em>For the Mirror.</em>)</h3>
<p>The following account of Poland, may be acceptable at the
present time, when this heroic people are making a noble effort to
throw off the yoke of Russian despotism.</p>
<p>As a kingdom, Poland is swept from the map of nations; but when
geographically considered, is of no small importance: it lies
between forty-six and fifty-seven degrees of north latitude, and
between sixteen and thirty-four degrees east longitude; and is
bounded north by Russia, south by Hungary and Turkey in Europe,
east by Russia, west by Prussia and Germany. Poland is in general a
very level country, (if we except the Carpathian mountains,)
fertile in corn, having long furnished Sweden and Holland; its
horses are some of the finest in Europe, and its salt-works are
very productive; the towns collectively are built of wood; the
appearance of the villages very mean.</p>
<p>This was the country of the ancient Vandals; it was made a duchy
about the end of the seventh century; in the tenth, Christianity
was introduced, and Boleslaus erected it into a monarchy in 999.
The form of government was here very singular: it was the only
elective monarchy in Europe, and the Poles, in the choice of a
king, did not always confine themselves to a countryman; at one
time all nations were eligible. The king was elected by the whole
body of the nobility and gentry in the plains of Warsaw, and before
this choice they obliged him to sign whatever conditions they
thought proper. The Polish armies were not paid by the king; every
nobleman or gentleman gave his attendance in time of war, at the
head of his vassals, and retired from the fatigues of the campaign
when it suited his own inclination. In the year 1779, a singularly
bold partition of this country was effected by Russia, Prussia, and
Austria; Russia laid claim to part of Lithuania, Polesia, Podolia,
Volhinia, and part of the Ukraine. This immense tract of country,
containing 8,000,000 souls, is become part and parcel of the
Russian territory. Prussia claimed Great Poland, the other part of
Lithuania, and Polish Russia. The only part of Poland retained by
Prussia, is the Grand Duchy of Posen, containing 538 geographical
square miles, and 1,051,137 inhabitants. Its chief towns are
Bromberg and Posen. Austria seized on Little Poland and Red Russia,
leaving to the King of Poland only Samogitia, Mascovia, and
Polachia; even this small territory was wrested from him, and in
1795, he was obliged to resign his crown. That part of Poland which
is subject to Austria, bears the designation of the kingdom of
Galicia and Lodomiria. Its population amounts to 4,370,000 souls.
The present kingdom of Poland is hereditary in the person of the
Russian autocrat and his successors, and comprises a superfices of
6,340 square leagues, having a population of 3,850,000 souls. It is
divided into eight waiwodeships, namely, Warsaw, Landomir, Kalish,
Lublin, Plotzk, Mascovia, Podolachia, and Augustowo. Its rivers are
the Vistula, Warte, Bug, Dnieper, Niemen, and Dwina. The national
revenues amounted (prior to the present contest) to
&pound;2,280,000. sterling, about the seventh part of which was
assigned to the civil list. Its military force during the despotic
government of the Grand Duke Constantine, was 30,000 infantry, and
20,000 cavalry; at present it is estimated at 70,000 infantry,
20,000 cavalry, and 50,000 men armed with scythes. Warsaw, with
126,433 inhabitants, is its capital, and next stand in succession
Landomir, 50,000 inhabitants; Lublin, 12,000; and Kalies, 8,500.
The Catholic religion predominates, but the number of Jews and
Socinians is great. There are more than 2,000,000 Jews dispersed
through Poland, independent of those resident as merchants in the
principal towns. Socinius resided many years at Cracow, and married
the daughter of a Polish nobleman. According to a distinguished
Polish historian, M. Chodzko, the population of the different
provinces of Ancient Poland amounted, in 1824, to about 19,000,000
of inhabitants.</p>

<h2>FINE ARTS.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>MR. HAYDON&rsquo;S PICTURE OF NAPOLEON MUSING AT ST.
HELENA.</h3>
<p>This picture has, we understand, been painted for Sir Robert
Peel, whose taste and munificence in patronizing the fine arts
cannot be too highly praised. It is throughout a masterly
performance, and one of which the English school of art has just
cause to be proud. We intend to let Mr. Haydon describe it in his
own vivid style:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Napoleon was peculiarly alive to poetical association as
produced by scenery or sound; village bells with their echoing
ding, dong, dang, now bursting full on the ear, now dying in the
wind, affected him as they affect every body alive to natural
impressions, and in the eve of all his great battles, you find him
stealing away in the dead of the night, between the two hosts, and
indulging in every species of poetical reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was impossible to think of such a genius in captivity,
without mysterious associations of the sky, the sea, the rock, and
the solitude with which he was enveloped, I never imagined him but
as if musing at dawn, or melancholy at sun-set, listening at
midnight to the beating and roaring of the Atlantic, or meditating
as the stars gazed and the moon shone on him: in short Napoleon
never appeared to me but at those moments of silence and twilight,
when nature seems to sympathize with the fallen and when if there
be moments fit, in this turbulent earth, for celestial intercourse,
one must imagine these would be the moments immortal spirits might
select to descend within the sphere of mortality, to soothe and
comfort, to inspire and support the afflicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under such impressions the present picture was
produced,&mdash;I imagined him standing on the brow of an impending
cliff and musing on his past fortunes,&mdash;imagined sea birds
screaming at his feet,&mdash;the sun just down,&mdash;the sails of
his guard ship glittering on the horizon, and the Atlantic, calm,
silent, awfully deep, and endlessly extensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried it in a small sketch, and it was instantly
purchased,&mdash;I published a print and the demand is now and has
been incessant; a commission for a picture the full size of life,
from one well known as the friend of artists and patron of art
followed, and thus I have ventured to think a conception so
unexpectedly popular might, on this enlarged scale, not be
uninteresting to the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble has been spared to render the picture a
resemblance, its height is Napoleon&rsquo;s exact height, according
to Constant, his valet, viz. five feet two inches and three
quarters, French, or five feet five inches and a half, English; the
uniform is that of one of the regiments of Chasseurs, every detail
has been dictated by an old officer of the regiment; and his
celebrated hat has been faithfully copied from one of
Napoleon&rsquo;s own hats now in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best description I ever saw of Napoleon&rsquo;s
appearance was in the letter of an Irish gentleman, named North,
published in the <em>Dublin Evening Post</em>, and as it is so very
characteristic, it may amuse the visiter. He saw him at Elba in
1814, and thus paints him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He but little resembles the notion I had of him, or any
other man I ever saw. He is the squarest figure I think I ever
remember to have seen, and exceedingly corpulent. His face is a
perfect square, from the effects of fat, and, as he has no
whiskers, his jaw is thrown more into relief; this description,
joined to his odd little three-cornered cocked hat, and very plain
clothes, would certainly give him the appearance of a vulgar
person, if the impression was not counteracted by his evil
soldierly carriage, and the peculiar manner of his walking, which
is confident, theatrical and a little ruffian like, for he stamps
the ground at every step, and at the same time twists his body a
little. He was dressed that day in a green coat, turned up with a
dirty white, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. His neck is short, his
shoulders very broad, and his chest open * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;His features are remarkably masculine, regular and well
formed. His skin is coarse, unwrinkled and weather-beaten, his eyes
possess a natural and unaffected fierceness, the most extraordinary
I ever beheld: they are full, bright, and of a brassy colour. He
looked directly at me, and his stare is by far the most intense I
ever beheld. This time, however, curiosity made me a match, for I
vanquished him. It is when he regards you, that you mark the
singular expression of his eyes&mdash;no frown&mdash;no
ill-humour&mdash;no affectation of appearing terrible; but the
genuine expression of an iron, inexorable temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have only to remark that the picture appears to us
exceedingly well drawn, and equally coloured. Objection has been
made to the large size of the epaulettes, and the colouring of the
sea. To the first opinion we may subscribe, but doubt whether the
objection ought to extend to the latter, especially if we remember
the great height of the cliff on which Napoleon stands, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>[pg
279]</span> usual sombre appearance of the ocean towards the last
minute of sunset. The lower part of the figure, particularly the
left leg, half advanced, is admirably drawn.</p>
<p>The effect of the picture, on the spectator entering the room,
is one of the most extraordinary character. Its general
outline&mdash;Napoleon standing on the crest of a tremendous cliff,
with his back nearly turned to the spectator, the vast Atlantic,
and the parting glow of the sun&mdash;the figure too, the size of
life&mdash;will, in some measure, prepare him for this effect,
which we confess ourselves at a loss to describe. Its very grandeur
impresses us with awe, and our afterthought becomes tinged with
melancholy from associating the fate of the illustrious original
with the towering cliff,&mdash;the vasty sea,&mdash;the dying
splendour of the sun, and the specky sail of the guard ship
fluttering in its last light. Yet how delightful is it to reflect
that such effects are within the span of a few square yards of
canvass, and how ennobling is the recollection that genius,
(ill-fostered as it has been in the case of the painter before us)
enables one man to produce such sublime and agreeable impressions
on his fellows. To step from the busy <em>pav&eacute;</em> of New
Bond-street and its busy whirl of fashion to this placid meer of
reflection is a contrast almost too severe for some of the puling
votaries of London gaiety: yet the scene teems with deep-souled
poetry. Some such feelings as those so touchingly expressed in Lord
Byron&rsquo;s Ode to Napoleon, on his first exile, flit through the
memory:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then haste thee to thy sullen isle,</p>
<p class="i2">And gaze upon the sea;</p>
<p>That element may meet thy smile,</p>
<p class="i2">It ne&rsquo;er was ruled by thee!</p>
<p>Or trace with thine all idle hand</p>
<p>In loitering mood upon the sand</p>
<p class="i2">That earth is now as free.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps we ought not to mention an idea we sometimes
entertain&mdash;that our readers may imagine we are partial to Mr.
Haydon, and that we pay an undue share of attention to his works.
The truth, however, is that his pictures always work upon us with
greater intensity than those of any other living artist. Further,
we know Mr. Haydon but by his works. We are acquainted with the
original of Pharaoh, in his great picture of <em>the Plague</em>,
but this association has nothing to do with our admiration of Mr.
Haydon&rsquo;s genius. One of the
specimens&mdash;<em>Eucles</em>&mdash;will not soon be absent from
our mind&rsquo;s eye; and for days after we first saw it, the
sorrowful mother, and the ghastly, falling figure of the warrior,
haunted our imagination at every turn.</p>

<h2>THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF <em>NEW WORKS</em>.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>THE ARCHITECTURE OF BIRDS.</h3>
<p>This is another volume of the delightful Zoological series of
the <em>Library of Entertaining Knowledge</em>. We have already a
volume and a half of Quadrupeds from the Menageries, a volume of
the Transformations of Insects, and another of their Architectural
Labours. The present, in well-chosen continuity of a novel plan of
illustrating the Animal economy, is devoted to &ldquo;an
examination of Birds in the exercise of their mechanical arts of
constructing Nests.&rdquo; &ldquo;This work,&rdquo; observes the
ingenious Editor, &ldquo;is the <em>business</em> of their
lives&mdash;the duty which calls forth that wonderful ingenuity,
which no experience can teach, and which no human skill can
rival.&rdquo; The few introductory pages include a rapid sketch of
the methods of classifying Birds adopted by some of the most
distinguished naturalists, in which their characteristics are
stripped of the jargon of technicality and <em>hard words</em>:
thus, &ldquo;Diurnal&rdquo; birds are explained as &ldquo;preying
in the day-time;&rdquo; &ldquo;Piscivorous, feeding upon
fish;&rdquo; &ldquo;Passeres, or Sparrows;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Columb&aelig;, or Pigeons,&rdquo; &amp;c. An outline of Mr.
Vigors&rsquo;s Quinary System, is also given, and the reader
referred to proper sources for illustrations. The Editor then,
leaving the beaten path of his predecessors, rambles through
&ldquo;fields and forests, unfettered by system, but alive to
whatever he meets with likely to interest for its curiosity or its
novelty.&rdquo; The birds are classed according to their peculiar
labours: thus, there are Mining Birds, Ground Builders, Mason and
Carpenter Birds, Platform Builders, Basket-making Birds, Weaver
Birds, Tailor Birds, Felt-making Birds, Cementers, Dome-builders,
and Parasite Birds. Each division is so abundantly attractive to
the observer of Nature in field or folio, that we scarcely know how
to decide on an extract; and the reader will readily admit this
dilemma, if he but recollects the early enthusiasm, wonder, and
delight, with which he must have regarded a <em>Bird&rsquo;s
Nest</em>, unless he has been pent up all his life in the brick and
mortar and chimney groves of a metropolis. Even then, the ingenuity
of rooks may have occurred to him as not a whit less wonderful than
the proud glories of art with which he has been environed. It is,
however, time to determine, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280"
name="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span> and we, accordingly, choose the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p><em>The Osprey.</em></p>
<p>It would appear that the Americans are very fond of these birds,
from some prevalent superstition connected with them. &ldquo;It has
been considered,&rdquo; says Dr. S. Mitchill, of New York, &ldquo;a
fortunate incident to have a nest and a pair of these birds on
one&rsquo;s farm. They have, therefore, been generally respected,
and neither the axe nor the gun has been lifted against them. Their
nest continues from year to year. The same couple, or another, as
the case may be, occupies it season after season. Repairs are duly
made; or, when demolished by storms, it is industriously rebuilt.
There was one of these nests, formerly, upon the leafless summit of
a venerable chestnut-tree, on our farm, directly in front of the
house, at the distance of less than half a mile. The withered trunk
and boughs, surmounted by the coarse-wrought and capacious nest,
was a more picturesque object than an obelisk; and the flights of
the hawks, as they went forth to hunt, returned with their game,
exercised themselves in wheeling round and round, and circling
about it, were amusing to the beholder, almost from morning till
night. The family of these hawks, old and young, was killed by the
Hessian jagers. A succeeding pair took possession of the nest; but,
in the course of time, the prongs of the trunk so rotted away that
the nest could no longer be supported. The hawks have been obliged
to seek new quarters. We have lost this part of our prospect, and
our trees have not afforded a convenient site for one of their
habitations since.&rdquo;<a id="footnotetag4" name=
"footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Herons and Heronries.</em></p>
<p>The several species of herons may not improperly be ranked among
the platform builders; for though they construct a shallow
depression in the centre of the nest, which is by all the species,
if we mistake not, lined with some sort of soft material, such as
dry grass, rushes, feathers, or wool, the body of the nest is quite
flat, and formed much in the manner of an eagle&rsquo;s eyry, of
sticks crossing one another, and supported upon the branches or
between the forks of high trees. All the species also are social,
nestling in large communities, after the manner of rooks; though
instances are not uncommon of individual pairs breeding solitary.
Belon tells us, that &ldquo;the heron is royal meat, on which the
French nobility set great value;&rdquo; and he mentions it as one
of the extraordinary feats performed by the &ldquo;divine
king,&rdquo; Francis I., that he formed two artificial heronries at
Fontainbleau;&mdash;&ldquo;the very elements themselves,&rdquo; he
adds, &ldquo;obeying the commands of this divine king (whom God
absolve!); for, to force nature, is a work partaking of
divinity!&rdquo;<a id="footnotetag5" name=
"footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> In order
to enhance the merit of these French heronries, he undertakes to
assert that they were unknown to the ancients, because they are not
mentioned in any of their writings; and for the same reason, he
concludes that there are none in Britain. Before Belon&rsquo;s
time, on the contrary, and before the &ldquo;divine&rdquo;
constructor of heronries in France was born, there were express
laws enacted in England for the protection of herons, it being a
fine of ten shillings to take the young out of the nests,<a id=
"footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href=
"#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> and six shillings and eightpence for
a person, without his own grounds, killing a heron, except by
hawking or by the long-bow;<a id="footnotetag7" name=
"footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> while, in
subsequent enactments, the latter penalty was increased to twenty
shillings, or three months&rsquo; imprisonment.<a id="footnotetag8"
name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> At
present, however, in consequence of the discontinuance of hawking,
little attention is paid to the protection of heronries. Not to
know a hawk from a <em>heronshaw</em> (the former name for a heron)
was an old adage, which arose when the diversion of heron-hawking
was in high fashion. It has since been corrupted into the absurd
vulgar proverb, &ldquo;not to know a hawk from a
handsaw!&rdquo;<a id="footnotetag9" name=
"footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> The flesh
of the heron is now looked upon as of little value, and rarely if
ever brought to market, though formerly a heron was estimated at
thrice the value of a goose, and six times the price of a
partridge.<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href=
"#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The heronries recorded to be existing at present in this country
are in Windsor Great Park, on the borders of Bagshot Heath; at
Penshurst-place, Kent; at Hutton, the seat of Mr. Bethel, near
Beverley, in Yorkshire; at Pixton, the seat of Lord Carnarvon; in
Gobay Park, on the road to Penrith, near a rocky pass called Yew
Crag, on the north side of the romantic lake of Ulswater; at Cressi
Hall, six miles from Spalding, in Lincolnshire; at
Downington-in-Holland, in the same county; at Brockley Woods, near
Bristol;<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href=
"#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> at Brownsea Island, near Poole, in
Dorsetshire; and, in Scotland, Colonel Montagu mentions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>[pg
281]</span> one in a small island, in a lake, where, there being
only a single scrubby oak, much too scanty to contain all the
nests, many were placed on the ground.<a id="footnotetag12" name=
"footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a> Besides
these, we are acquainted with a small one in the parish of Craigie,
near Kilmarnock, in Ayrshire.<a id="footnotetag13" name=
"footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> We have
little doubt but there are several more unrecorded, for the birds
may occasionally be seen in every part of the island. In Lower
Brittany, heronries are frequently to be found on the tall trees of
forests; and as they feed their young with fish, many of these fall
to the ground, and are greedily devoured by swine, which has given
rise to the story that the swine of that country are fattened by
fish which drop from the trees like beech-mast.<a id=

<p>At the close of the volume are a few well-digested observations,
which will leave the reader in a delightful train of reflection,
impress him with the value of the preceding pages, and enable him
to close the volume with gratitude to its author:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although, in the preceding pages, we have considered
birds as miners, as ground-builders, as masons, as carpenters, as
platform-builders, as basket-makers, as weavers, as tailors, as
felt-makers, as cementers, and as dome-builders, we have not dwelt
at much length upon any fancied analogies between their arts and
those of the human race. The great distinction between man and the
inferior animals is, that the one learns almost every art
progressively, by his own experience operating with the accumulated
knowledge of past generations, whilst the others work by a fixed
rule, improving very little, if any, during the course of their own
lives, and rarely deviating to-day from the plans pursued by the
same species a thousand years ago. It is true that the swallow,
which doubtless once built its nest in hollow trees, has now
accommodated itself to the progress of human society by choosing
chimneys for nestling; and it is also to be noticed, that in the
selection of materials a great many birds, as we have already
shown, accommodate themselves to their individual opportunities of
procuring substances differing in some degree from those used in
other situations by the same species. These adaptations only show
that the instinct which guides them to the construction of the
nests best fitted to their habits is not a blind one; that it is
very nearly allied to the reasoning faculty, if it is not
identified with it. But that the rule by which birds conduct their
architectural labours is exceedingly limited must be evident, from
the consideration that no species whatever is in a state of
progression from a rude to a polished style of construction. There
is nearly as much difference between the comparative beauty of the
nests of a wood-pigeon and a bottle-tit, as between the hut of a
North American savage and a Grecian temple. But although the
savage, in the course of ages, may attain as much civilization as
would lead him to the construction of a new Parthenon, the
wood-pigeon will continue only to make a platform of sticks to the
end of time. It is evident, from a contemplation of all nature,
that the faculties of quadrupeds, birds, insects, and all the
inferior animals, are stationary: those of man only are
progressive. It is this distinction which enables him, agreeably to
the will of his Creator, to &lsquo;have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and
over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth.&rsquo;&mdash;But within their limited range the
inferior animals perform their proper labours with an unwearied
industry, and an unerring precision, which call forth our wonder
and admiration. Of these remarkable qualities we have given
abundant examples in the preceding pages; and they are not without
moral instruction. Elevated as our minds are in the comparative
scale of nature, we may still take example from the diligence, the
perseverance, and the cheerfulness, which preside over the
<em>Architecture of Birds.</em>&rdquo;</p>

common-place character.</p>

<h3>TOMB OF PAUL AND VIRGINIA.</h3>
<p>Junior lieutenants and midshipmen, and others of the age of
romance, always make it a point to visit these tombs as soon as
possible after their arrival. If they can only get on shore for a
few hours, they hire or borrow horses, and proceed with all haste
to the interesting scene. On reaching the spot to which they are
directed, they enter a pretty garden, laid out with great care, and
are conducted along a walk bordered with bushes, bearing a
profusion of roses, and having a stream of the clearest water
flowing on each side. At the end of this walk the visiter sees a
red, glaring monument, which he is told is the tomb <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span> of
Virginia; at the termination of a similar avenue, on the opposite
side of the garden, appears another monument, exactly resembling
the first, which is designated the tomb of Paul: a grove of bamboos
surrounds each. The traveller feels disappointed on beholding these
red masses, instead of elegant monuments of Parian marble, which
would seem alone worthy of such a purpose and such a situation. But
that is not the only disappointment destined to be experienced by
him: after having allowed his imagination to depict the shades of
Paul and Virginia hovering about the spot where their remains
repose&mdash;after having pleased himself with the idea that he had
seen those celebrated tombs, and given a sigh to the memory of
those faithful lovers, separated in life, but in death
united&mdash;after all this waste of sympathy, he learns at last
that he has been under a delusion the whole time&mdash;that no
Virginia was there interred, and that it is a matter of doubt
whether there ever existed such a person as Paul! What a pleasing
illusion is then dispelled! How many romantic dreams, inspired by
the perusal of St. Pierre&rsquo;s tale, are doomed to vanish when
the truth is ascertained! The fact is, that these tombs have been
built to gratify the eager desire which the English have always
evinced to behold such interesting mementos. Formerly only one was
erected; but the proprietor of the place, finding that all the
English visiters, on being conducted to this, as the tomb of
Virginia, always asked to see that of Paul also, determined on
building a similar one, to which he gave that appellation. Many
have been the visiters who have been gratified, consequently, by
the conviction that they had looked on the actual burial-place of
that unfortunate pair. These &ldquo;tombs&rdquo; are scribbled over
with the names of the various persona who have visited them,
together with verses and pathetic ejaculations, and sentimental
remarks. St. Pierre&rsquo;s story of the lovers is very prettily
written, and his description of the scenic beauties of the island
are correct, although not even his pen can do full justice to them;
but there is little truth in the tale. It is said, that there was
indeed a young lady sent from the Mauritius to France, for
education, during the time that Monsieur de la Bourdonnais was
governor of the colony&mdash;that her name was Virginia, and that
she was shipwrecked in the St. Geran. I heard something of a young
man being attached to her, and dying of grief for her loss; but
that part of the story is very doubtful. The &ldquo;Bay of the
Tomb,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Point of Endeavour,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Isle
of Amber,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Cape of Misfortune,&rdquo; still
bear the same names, and are pointed out as the memorable spots
mentioned by St. Pierre.&mdash;<em>Recollections of the
Mauritius</em>.</p>

<h2>THE COSMOPOLITE.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>COINCIDENT POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>
<h4>(<em>For the Mirror</em>.)</h4>
<p>In No. 475 of the <em>Mirror</em>, p. 98, will be found an
article by a correspondent (H.) on &ldquo;English
Superstition,&rdquo; introducing a very interesting Cheshire
legend, as a counterpart to a Scottish one, related by the
celebrated author of &ldquo;Demonology and Witchcraft.&rdquo; H.
remarks of his tale that &ldquo;it gives rise to many interesting
conjectures respecting the probable causes of such a superstition
being believed in countries with apparently so little connexion or
intercourse as Cheshire and Scotland.&rdquo; Perhaps it may be as
well to refer to what Sir W. Scott has said upon this very subject,
in note xi. to canto 4 of his &ldquo;Lady of the Lake,&rdquo; ere
we proceed to utter a few specimens of coincident
superstitions:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A work of great interest might be compiled upon the
origin of popular fiction, and the transmission of similar tales
from age to age, and from country to country. The mythology of one
period would then appear to pass into the romance of the next
century&mdash;and that, into the nursery tale of subsequent ages.
Such an investigation, while it went greatly to diminish our ideas
of the richness of human invention, would also show that these
fictions, however wild and childish, possess such charms for the
populace, as enable them to penetrate into countries unconnected by
manners and language, and having no apparent intercourse to afford
the means of transmission. It would carry me far beyond my bounds
to produce instances of this community of fable, among nations who
never borrowed from each other anything intrinsically worth
learning. Indeed, the wide diffusion of popular fictions may be
compared to the facility with which straws and feathers are
dispersed abroad by the wind, while valuable metals cannot be
transported without trouble and labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Walter, in appending this observation to a tradition
extracted from &ldquo;Grahame&rsquo;s Sketches of Scenery in
Perthshire&rdquo; pp. 116-118, remarks&mdash;&ldquo;that this
story, translated by Dr. G. from a <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page283" name="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span> Gaelic tradition, is
to be found in the <em>Otia Imperialia</em> of Gervase of
Tilbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, it is not a little singular, that of the self-same legend
we have also an original edition, received from a Welsh woman, as
it is current in Wales, and &ldquo;believed to be true in the place
where it happened&rdquo;&mdash;as she averred&mdash;but whereabout
in Cambria that was she failed to inform us. Here, then, is her
account of a fairy favour:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>accoucheuse</em> of a small village in Wales was
one night aroused by a carriage driving furiously through it, and
stopping at her door. A gentleman hastily alighted, entered her
humble abode, and, stating that his lady required her assistance,
scarcely allowed the good woman time to wrap a few garments around
her, ere he hurried her into the carriage, which drove off with
both of them, as if coachman and horses were mad. After the lapse
of a few minutes the carriage stopped; the good woman was taken
out, and ushered into a most splendid mansion&mdash;although the
midnight darkness was too great to allow of her noticing its
exterior and situation. After the infant was born, being about to
wash and dress it, a box of some kind of ointment was put into her
hands, wherewith she was desired to anoint it all over; and in
doing this she happened to rub one of her eyes.&mdash;At last, her
attendance being no longer required, she was re-conveyed to her own
abode, in the same manner as she had been taken from it; but,
although she subsequently noticed most particularly all the
gentlemen&rsquo;s houses in the vicinity, she was never able to
discover that to which she had been taken;&mdash;neither did she
ever behold the gentleman again, until many months afterwards,
being at a wake in the neighbourhood, she saw, to her supreme
astonishment, that mysterious stranger, liberally helping himself,
without money and without leave, from the stalls!&mdash;Averse to
noticing the fact, oar honest woman resolved, nevertheless, to
accost him; and making her way up to where he stood, asked after
the health of his lady and child, regretting that she had not been
able to call and see them, since she had failed in every endeavour
to find the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are well,&rsquo; said the stranger;
&lsquo;but how came you to know that I was here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because, sir, I saw, and do see you,&rsquo;
replied the unsuspecting gossip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With which eye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With both, to be sure,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I rather think not,&rsquo; rejoined the
gentleman&mdash;&lsquo;try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon making the experiment, the poor woman discovered, to
her infinite surprise, that she could only see the stranger with
that eye which she had accidently rubbed with the
unguent;&mdash;upon which the enraged fairy&mdash;for such he
was&mdash;spitting into it, deprived it of the faculty of sight for
ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this story we have reason to believe that there are various
readings, besides those of the Scotch and Welsh, and that it may be
met with in England and Ireland, with slight variations and
interpolations, if in no other countries.</p>
<p>Have our readers ever heard any fearful story of a spirit
attesting the reality of its apparition, by leaving a burnt impress
of fingers upon whatever it hath touched? We have heard such a
tale, or rather such tales (for literally they are
&ldquo;legion&rdquo;) from many lips, the circumstances of each
being varied, but the main fact always the same: and, what is most
extraordinary, always vouched for as being a portion of family
history, attached to families who have not the slightest connexion
with each other!&mdash;If our memory is not extremely treacherous,
we believe that Sir Walter Scott, in one of his works (of which we
have not the good fortune to possess a copy)&mdash;probably his
&ldquo;Ballads and Lyrical Pieces&rdquo;&mdash;gives such a tale as
a German tradition. It is, at least, extremely popular; but the
Irish family of the Beresfords lay peculiar and original claim to
this singular legend. Who has not heard of &ldquo;The Beresford
Ghost?&rdquo;&mdash;Nay, but we must crave the liberty of
re-publishing an oft-told tale, were it only in gratitude to some
kind and esteemed Irish friends, who, believing that it might prove
a novelty to several English readers, procured for us&mdash;from a
lineal descendant of the family, and inheritor of the name,
&amp;c.&mdash;the following genuine and authentic document,
concerning the celebrated Beresford Ghost:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Tristram Beresford was a general, in the service of
King George I., who married Lady Hamilton, one of the co-heiresses
of Lord Glenawley; and having large estates in the county of
Tyrone, the family mansion of which was the Castle of Ballygawley,
there Sir Tristram and his lady resided. Sir T. was ordered to join
his regiment, then serving in Flanders;&mdash;he was severely
wounded in an engagement, and reported to be dead. The means of
communication with most places being in those days extremely
difficult and uncertain, Lady Beresford had no means <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span> of
knowing that the report of her husband&rsquo;s death was premature;
but firmly believing it, she married immediately, as it should
seem, a young officer named Georges, to whom she had long been
greatly attached. The demise of Sir Tristram Beresford did not, in
fact, take place till some days after their union; but on the night
when it actually occurred, Captain Georges and his lady having
retired to rest, a figure resembling Sir Tristram stood beside
their bed, and having undrawn the curtains nearest his late wife,
upbraided her with the indecent haste she had used in concluding
her second marriage, which had caused her, in fact, to be for many
days guilty of an adulterous connexion with her present
husband.&mdash;She asked him, whether he were yet living?&mdash;He
answered, that he had died that very hour; and also said, that she
had made a disastrous choice, for that her husband would prove very
unkind to her, and that she should die in giving birth to their
fifth child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain G. had fallen into a profound slumber, from
which, although during this conversation his wife made every effort
to arouse him, he could not be awakened. She then said to the
semblance of Sir Tristram&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How shall I know that this is not a trick, and
that you are not some person disguised to deceive me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon which the spectre took up the curtains of the bed,
which were suspended from a ring over the tester, and throwing them
from his hand, passed them through the ring thrice,
saying&mdash;&lsquo;No human being could do that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And yet, replied the lady, it is possible that
people may say I did it myself. Can you give me no better
token?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the spectre caught her by the wrist,
exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;Unto thee shall this be a
token!&rsquo;&mdash;when the sinews of that wrist immediately
shrivelled up, and the apparition, laying his hand on an
escritoire, vanished!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Georges instantly awoke; and his lady asking him
whether he had seen or heard any thing, he replied in the negative;
but the sinews of her wrist were seared and shrunken ever after,
and the impression of a hand was burnt into the escritoire.<a id=
"footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href=
"#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly afterwards accounts arrived, identifying the hour
of Sir Tristram&rsquo;s decease with that in which his apparition
had appeared to his widow; and she was a second time married to
Capt. Georges, with whom she lived some years, and had four
children; but as she experienced much ill-treatment from him, they
parted: he joined his regiment, and she continued to reside in
Ballygawley Castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some years after this separation, they again became
friends. He returned to reside with her; and in giving birth to
their fifth child, she died, as had been foretold by the
apparition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of Sir Tristram by this lady was Sir Marcus
Beresford, who married the heiress of the estates and title of Le
Pen; was created Baron Beresford and Earl of Tyrone; and was father
of George Beresford, first Marquess of Waterford, the late Right
Hon. John Beresford, William Beresford, late Archbishop of Tuam,
Lady Frances Flood, Lady Araminta Monk, Lady Catherine Jones, Lady
Glenawley, and Lady Betty Cobbe.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>OLD PARR AND OLD PEOPLE.</h3>
<h4>(<em>From &ldquo;After Dinner Chat,&rdquo; in the New Monthly
Magazine.</em>)</h4>
<p><em>N</em>.&mdash;Parr was a mischievous old fellow: he has left
a pernicious example of longevity behind him. At sixty-nine a man
will look with complacency to the approaching termination of his
career, as an event to be expected in the ordinary course of
Nature. Once allow him to turn seventy, he has then escaped the
fatal three-score-and-ten, and would consider himself an ill-used
person should he receive notice of ejectment a day short of ninety.
Ninety comes, and he grows insolent. Death, he thinks, has passed
on and overlooked him. He asks why Nature so long has delayed to
claim her debt. She has suffered thrice seven years to elapse
beyond the period usually assigned for payment, and he indulges in
wild fancies of a Statute of Limitations. In his most rational
moments he talks of nothing but Old Parr. He burns his will,
marries his housemaid, hectors his son-and-heir, who is seventy,
and canes his grand-child (a lad of fifty) for keeping late hours.
I called on old S&mdash;g a morning or two ago: he is ninety-three.
I found him reading his newspaper, and inveighing against the
outcry for Reform and short Parliaments&mdash;declaring that,
rather than be forced down into Cheshire to vote oftener than once
in every six or seven years, he, for his part, would sell his
franchise for a straw. &lsquo;Twas clear he had outlived the
recollection of the probability of a visit from one who might
deprive him of his franchise upon terms even less advantageous. I
took occasion to compliment him upon his fine old age. His reply
was an angry growl.&mdash;&ldquo;Ugh! do you want me gone?
I&rsquo;m only ninety-three Ugh! Mr. Parr wouldn&rsquo;t die till
he was one hundred and sixty!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>R</em>.&mdash;Paying a visit to old P&mdash;ke, I found him
walking up and down the drawing-room, stamping and raving, and
holding a handkerchief to his mouth. I inquired what ailed him. To
my astonishment, he complained of <em>tooth-ache</em>!&mdash;a
strange complaint, thought I, for a man of seventy-eight, whom one
would hardly expect to find with a single implement of that kind in
his head; but, in fact, he was in possession of the whole set,
<em>except two</em>! His lamentation, which he continued at
intervals, ran in this
strain&mdash;&ldquo;Seventy-eight!&mdash;only seventy-eight, and
two teeth gone already!&mdash;lost <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page286" name="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span> one of them sixty
years ago, and, as if that were not enough, four years ago I must
lose a second;&mdash;and now&mdash;ah! I suppose I must part with
another. And then my eyes! one of my eyes is beginning to fail.
Lord help me! for, should it go on at this rate, I shall be in a
sad condition before many more years are over my head!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>S</em>.&mdash;The unconscionable old rogue! at seventy-eight
how many more could he expect?</p>
<p><em>N</em>.&mdash;Rely on it I am right, and that Parr was to
blame for this. At seventy, P&mdash;ke would have died with
grateful thanksgivings on his lips for the blessings of his past
life. As it was, had he been allowed to live on till he should have
parted with the remainder of his teeth, at the rate of one a year,
he would have attempted, when it came to the last, to smuggle a
false tooth or two into his jaws.</p>
<p><em>R</em>.&mdash;I think I understand the gist of your
complaint: the longer you allow folks to live, the more they
won&rsquo;t die. Fie upon them!</p>
<p><em>S</em>.&mdash;I shudder at the contemplation of the
consequences of Parr&rsquo;s abominable example. Well had it been
for posterity if some one had killed the cent-sexagenarian at the
outset of his wicked career.</p>
<p><em>K</em>.&mdash;Horrible! that would have been
<em>Parr</em>-icide!</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>DUELLING.</p>
<p><em>N</em>.&mdash;Apropos of duelling. I hear that General
F&mdash;rn&mdash;r is dead. He was the most celebrated, or, I ought
to say, the most notorious duellist in France&mdash;at a time, too,
when duelling was most the rage. He had been a great favourite of
Napoleon&rsquo;s. Having the command of a regiment, upon&mdash;I
forget what occasion&mdash;he led it with such extraordinary
bravery to the attack, yet, at the same time, conducted its
movements with so total a want of skill and discretion, that,
without attaining any good result, his men were nearly all cut to
pieces, and he himself narrowly escaped with his life. As a reward
for his gallantry, his Imperial master promoted him to the rank of
general; but, to mark his sense of F&mdash;rn&mdash;r&rsquo;s total
want of &ldquo;the better part of valour,&rdquo; he never after
entrusted him with a command. So fatal was his skill in duelling,
that, when I knew him in Paris, he was under an interdiction of the
police ever to fight again. The terms of one of the duels in which
he had been engaged were, that the parties should fire at eight
paces, and that they should alternately advance two paces till the
fire of one or both of them should take deadly effect. According to
this arrangement, the last advance brought the muzzle of his pistol
close to his adversary&rsquo;s breast&mdash;he had twice already
wounded him slightly, and received one shot himself&mdash;he fired,
and his adversary fell dead at his feet! This piece of
butchery&mdash;for as such it must be stigmatized&mdash;having been
perpetrated under sanction of the articles of the meeting, passed
over without receiving any severe notice. No wonder he was an
unhappy man. I met him one day at dinner. On that occasion he was
boisterous in his mirth, without appearing to be
gay.&mdash;Suddenly he rose and left the room. Half an hour
afterwards we found him in a small <em>boudoir</em> at the farther
end of the apartment, stretched on a sofa&mdash;writhing, groaning,
and gnashing his teeth: I thought of Richard in the tent scene. I
once heard him say&mdash;(I must give part of his expression in his
own words, for terrible as they are, they are, at the same time, so
simple, that they would lose their force in
translation)&mdash;&rdquo;<em>J&rsquo;ai la bras fatal!</em> if I
fire at a mark ten to one I miss it: I never miss a man.&rdquo; His
look and tone, as he uttered this, were as of one who should speak
of an attendant demon, from whose dominion he had no power of
escape.</p>
<p><em>R</em>.&mdash;I once was witness to an instance of apathy on
the part of a father&mdash;your talking of duelling reminds me of
it&mdash;which is perhaps without a parallel. Walking one day
beyond the <em>Barri&egrave;re de Clichy</em>, I saw several
persons assembled at a little distance from the roadside. Two
gentlemen had just taken their ground&mdash;you know that these
affairs are not always conducted with the same privacy on the
Continent as in England&mdash;and received their pistols from the
hands of their seconds. They fired at the same instant. One of the
combatants, a line young man of about five-and-twenty, received his
adversary&rsquo;s shot in his forehead: it pierced his brain. He
sprang nearly his own height from the ground, and fell dead. He was
immediately carried home to his father&rsquo;s house, which was at
no great distance from the spot, and I went along with the crowd.
He was an only son, mind you, but (so it was said) a <em>mauvais
sujet</em> of the last degree&mdash;indeed the very quarrel which
led to the duel had occurred in a gaming-house of which he was a
regular frequenter. The body, which I followed into the courtyard
of his father&rsquo;s house, was placed on the stones. The father
was sent for;&mdash;a <em>scene</em> was <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span>
naturally to be expected;&mdash;and a scene to be remembered there
was. The old gentleman came out, looked calmly upon the dead body
of his son, deliberately took a pinch of snuff, tapped down the lid
of the box, and, saying nothing in the world more
than&mdash;<em>Enfin!</em>&mdash;walked in again.</p>

<h3>POLITICAL CHANGES.</h3>
<p>Presumptuous was the wish so patriotically conceived, and so
repeatedly extolled, of that pious churchman, who exclaimed, with
reference to the constitution of his native country, now no more
existing as an independent state, &ldquo;Esto perpetua!&rdquo; The
ancients, indeed, to secure what might be humanely termed a
perpetuity to their laws and edicts, had them graven on brass. But
what is the perpetuity even of brass itself, when opposed to the
irresistible advance of Time? Even in the very infancy of the
world, this question might have been answered, as it was, some few
thousand years after its creation, by Old Simonides:</p>

<h3>OLD PARLIAMENTS.</h3>
<p>There is nothing in our history more uncertain than their nature
and the extent of their power. Blackstone says, that &ldquo;the
original or first institution of parliaments is one of those
matters which lie so far hidden in the dark ages of antiquity, that
the tracing of it out is a thing equally difficult and uncertain;
and how members were returned to the <em>Michel-Synoth</em>, or
<em>Michel-Gemote</em>, or <em>Wittena-Gemote</em>, of our Saxon
ancestors, it would doubtless puzzle the learning even of Lord John
Russell to ascertain.&rdquo; In the simple days of good King
Alfred, parliaments were not summoned for &ldquo;the dispatch of
business&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to discuss regulations touching the
taxes and the public debt&mdash;the Bank affairs&mdash;the East
India affairs&mdash;the West India affairs, and a thousand other
concerns of national moment, then lying unborn in the womb of time.
In those days, the great council was ordained to &ldquo;meet twice
in the year, or oftener, if need be, to treat of the government of
God&rsquo;s people, how they should keep themselves from, sin,
should live in quiet, and should receive
right.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Blackwood&rsquo;s Mag</em>.</p>

<h3>HOW TO ROAST AN ACTOR.</h3>
<p>If he is tall, you may discover that his person is ungraceful,
and that he wants the dapper-size of Garrick. If short, he is much
under the proper size, and can never play the character of a hero,
which is always fixed at five feet ten inches. If his features are
small, you can find out that they want expression; if large, his
face is vulgar, and his nose too much beyond the dramatic size. If
his face be unexceptionable, you may with some pains discover a
<em>something</em> in his eye. If his eyes are piercing and
intelligent, perhaps his features are stiff and unmanageable. His
shoulders may be broad; and, if not, it is a thousand to one but he
stoops; and if he stoops, and does not turn out his toes, it is
impossible he can understand his author. If he is a scholar and a
critic, and repeats a line as you never heard it repeated before,
he must be a word-catcher. If his manner is graceful, he has
studied dancing too much; but if his manner is not graceful, be
sure to tell him he must go to the dancing-school. If you can
discover no fault, you must prove how much better Garrick, Powel,
Holland, or Barry, performed the character; and as nine-tenths of
your readers cannot remember those performers, you may easily
persuade them that the object of your censure is a blockhead. If he
has the art of rapid elocution, tell him he speaks too fast; and if
he speaks slowly, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name=
"page288"></a>[pg 288]</span> with discrimination, say that he only
waits to catch applause. If his action is graceful, tell him he
makes too much use of his arms and hands; and if his action is
moderate, persuade the public that his arms are tied behind him. By
these hints you will have <em>done him</em> completely on one side,
and, if you change your opinion, and praise him, he will be done on
the other.&mdash;<em>Old Magazine</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>VALE OF TEMPE.</h3>
<p>Dr. Clarke says, &ldquo;The boasted Vale of Tempe, is a defile;
it is something like Matlock, but wilder; more savage than Salvator
Rosa, and with nothing of Claude. I cannot tell why the ancients
made such a fuss about it; perhaps because half of them never saw
it, and took its character from hearsay; the other half, like
mankind every where, stupidly admiring what is said to be
admirable. It is like a crack in a great wall, at the bottom of
which is a river, sometimes inundated, sometimes dry; the passage
narrow, the sides craggy, bare, lofty and perpendicular; its whole
length not above a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>THEATRES.</h3>
<p>We find the following sensible observations in a recent
work:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the reigns of Elizabeth and James, the golden age of
the English drama, London was not a tenth part of its present sire,
and it contained seventeen theatres. At present (1808) there are
but two; more would succeed, and indeed more are wanted; but these
have obtained exclusive privileges. Old people say the acting was
better in their younger days, because there were more schools for
actors; and the theatres being smaller, the natural voice could be
heard, and the natural expression of the features seen, and
therefore rant and distortion were unnecessary. They, however, who
remember no other generation of actors than the present, will not
be persuaded that there has ever been one more perfect. Be this as
it may, all are agreed that the drama itself has woefully
degenerated, though it is the only species of literary labour which
is well paid; they are agreed also as to the cause of this
degeneracy, attributing it to the prodigious size of the theatres;
the finer tones of passion cannot be discriminated, nor the finer
movements of the countenance perceived from the front, hardly from
the middle of the house. Authors, therefore, substitute what is
here called broad farce for genuine comedy; their jests are made
intelligible by grimace, or by that sort of mechanical wit which
can be seen; comedy is made up of trick, and tragedy of
processions, pageants, battles, and explosions.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>SCRAPS</h3>
<p>Addison says, that a dog has been the companion of man for
nearly 6,000 years, and has learned of him only one of his vices;
that is to worry his species when he finds them in distress. Tie a
tin canister to a dog&rsquo;s tail, and another will fall upon him;
put a man in prison for debt, and another will lodge a detainer
against him.</p>
<p>Horace Walpole, speaking of the opening of the budget one year,
says, &ldquo;The rest of the night was spent in a kind of
avoirdupoise war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A witness under examination in an Irish court of justice, had
just stated that he was suddenly roused from his slumbers by a blow
on the head. &ldquo;And how did you find yourself?&rdquo; asked the
examining counsel, &ldquo;Fast asleep,&rdquo; replied the
witness.</p>
<p>An officer whom Louis XIV. had been strongly solicited to
appoint to a certain situation, was presented to him. &ldquo;This
gentleman,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;is too old.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied the officer, with much tact, &ldquo;I
am only four years older than your majesty, and I calculate upon
serving you for five-and-twenty years to come.&rdquo; The king
appointed him to the situation.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
